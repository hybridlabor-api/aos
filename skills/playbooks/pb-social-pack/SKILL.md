# Release social pack
What you get: posts per platform and clip cut-downs from your release recap, every claim traceable to a fact, handed off for publishing after your GO.

## Inputs
- recap — release notes, or a pb-ship / pb-release-aos run log
- platforms — for example LinkedIn, X, Instagram, YouTube Shorts
- launch_video (optional) — an mp4 from pb-launch-video; without it the pack is posts only and step 4 is skipped; pb-launch-video renders with hyperframes when installed, else with the remotion skill
- formats (optional) — default 9:16 (1080x1920), 1:1 (1080x1080) and 16:9 (1920x1080)

## Steps
1. Preflight — `test -d ~/.claude/skills/content-engine`; absent → log "content-engine not installed: copywriting fallback" and continue. With launch_video: `command -v ffmpeg` and `command -v ffprobe`; either missing → stop with "Missing tool: <name>. Install ffmpeg and rerun." and write nothing except the run log — probes answered
2. Ask — recap path, platforms, slug, launch_video, formats → run log — all answered, recap file exists
3. quick-recap — recap → `social/<slug>/facts.md`, one numbered fact per line with its source line in the recap; no fact without a source — file written
4. content-engine (if present) or copywriting — facts.md → `social/<slug>/posts.md` per platform, each claim tagged `[F<n>]` — every claim has a tag that exists in facts.md — stops for approval
5. ffmpeg — launch_video → `social/<slug>/clips/<name>_<WxH>.mp4` per format and per requested cut, for example `ffmpeg -ss <start> -t <seconds> -i <video> -vf "scale=<W>:<H>:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase,crop=<W>:<H>" -c:a copy <out>`, then `ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width,height -of csv=p=0 <out>` — ffprobe equals the asked WxH for every clip; on a mismatch stop with "clip <file> has WxH, expected ...", do not publish
6. [GO] publish — platforms, post texts and the full clip list shown. The run stops here until the human types GO. No publish MCP exists, so the GO releases the hand-off: posts, clips and captions in `social/<slug>/publish.md`; upload is manual unless the human named a tool in step 2 — hand-off file written

Run log: `production_artifacts/pb-social-pack-<date>.md` in the start directory, never committed

Rules
- Anything other than the literal GO (case-insensitive) is not a GO; a GO covers only that one step, one time.
- A failed check stops the run: write the failure into the run log and report. No silent retries.
- GO is by contract in every harness. The go-gate hook is only a backstop on Claude Code, OpenCode and agy (Codex: unverified; Cursor, Kimi: none). A missing hook is never permission to proceed.
- Write one run-log line per step as it completes (`N. done|skipped|failed — artifact — check result`) and `WAITING FOR GO: <step>` at each gate.
