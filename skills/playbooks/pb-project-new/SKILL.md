# New private AOS project
What you get: a private GitHub repo with AOS bootstrapped, pushed, and a first CI run checked.

## Inputs
- name, owner — asked in step 1
- local_folder — where the clone goes, asked in step 1
- upstream_url (optional) — a repo to track as `upstream`, asked in step 1

## Steps
1. Ask — name, owner, local folder, optional upstream URL → run log header in the start directory (`production_artifacts/pb-project-new-<date>.md`, never committed) — all answered
2. [GO] github — from the parent of `<local_folder>` (`cd` there first; the clone lands in `<name>/`), `gh repo create <owner>/<name> --private --clone` → repo and local clone — The run stops here until the human types GO.
3. github — `gh repo view <owner>/<name> --json visibility -q .visibility` → value in the run log — must equal `PRIVATE`; otherwise fail-stop: write the value to the run log, tell the user, push nothing, and do not delete or change the repo (destructive actions need the user's confirmation)
4. Upstream given → `git remote add upstream <url>` — `git remote -v` shows it; never push to `upstream` (no `gh repo fork`: a fork of a public repo cannot be private)
5. aos-project-init — folder → `.aos/project.json`, `AGENTS.md` and symlinks, OpenWiki, memB project card, Synapse, CI choice (it may create triage labels and write `../WORKTREE.md`; aos-project-init asks for its own write-list approval) — doctor rows green or exceptions named, `.openwiki/` present; accept aos-project-init's own commit if it makes one, step 6 commits only what is left, never the run log
6. git commit `chore: bootstrap AOS project` — remaining bootstrap files → SHA — commit hook passes (skip if nothing is left)
7. [GO] `git branch -M main`, then git push -u origin main — SHA → remote — The run stops here until the human types GO.
8. pb-ci-fix — only if CI was chosen in step 5: run its step 10 (watch the run on the pushed SHA) → conclusion `success`; if red, hand over to `/pb-ci-fix` from its step 1 (it has its own GO); then re-run the step 3 check — still `PRIVATE`

Run log: `production_artifacts/pb-project-new-<date>.md` in the start directory, outside the new repo

Rules
- Anything other than the literal GO (case-insensitive) is not a GO; a GO covers only that one step, one time.
- A failed check stops the run: write the failure into the run log and report. No silent retries.
- Write one run-log line per step as it completes (`N. done|skipped|failed — artifact — check result`) and `WAITING FOR GO: <step>` at each gate.
