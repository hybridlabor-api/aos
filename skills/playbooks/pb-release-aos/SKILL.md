# Release AOS to npm
What you get: a new AOS version on npm through the release-please PR, never a hand bump, with the PR reviewed and gated before your GO.

## Inputs
- repo (optional) — the AOS checkout, default the current directory; `<owner/repo>` comes from `git -C <repo> remote get-url origin`

## Steps
1. Preflight — `gh auth status` and bdb-ecosystem-health listed in the harness skill list or its SKILL.md under the harness skills dir (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.config/opencode/skills`) → run log header — gh missing or unauthenticated → log it, give the `gh auth login` hint, stop; not installed → log "health skill not installed" and skip the drift report in step 7; the npm check still runs
2. github — commits since the last tag (`git -C <repo> fetch --tags`, then `git -C <repo> describe --tags --abbrev=0`, then `git -C <repo> log <tag>..HEAD --format=%s`) → subject list in the run log, every non-Conventional subject flagged (release-please cannot see it, see AGENTS.md) — stops for approval
3. github — `gh pr list -R <owner/repo> --state open --head release-please--branches--main --json number,title,headRefName` → the release PR number in the run log — none → stop with "no release PR"
4. Review and gate on that PR, using these skills:
   - git-pr-review — `gh pr view <n> -R <owner/repo> --json commits` → description draft in the run log — draft only, nothing posted
   - pr-recap — recap file written → link it; recap not buildable → log "pr-recap skipped: <reason>" and paste `gh pr diff <n> -R <owner/repo> --name-only` instead; no `npx` without approval
   - reviewer (agent; no subagent support → the main session reads agents/reviewer.md and runs the review inline, using only the diff and the contract, never the session's reasoning) — `gh pr diff <n> -R <owner/repo>`; the contract is the commit list from step 2, never the PR body → findings table — any open `blocking` finding stops the run
   - bdb-shipping-skill — door class of the release PR (two-way or one-way; unclear counts as one-way) → class in the run log; one-way → ADR-lite `production_artifacts/decisions/<date>-<slug>.md` — class recorded
   - godmode-shipping — `gh pr checks <n> -R <owner/repo>` all pass (pending, `gh pr checks` exit 8, counts as not passed), plus the local gate exactly as pb-ship step 8 gives it (scratch worktree from `pull/<n>/head`, lint, typecheck and test scripts that exist, a fork PR skips the local gate and is held, worktree removed without `--force`) → exit codes in the run log
5. [GO] github — `gh pr merge <n> -R <owner/repo> --squash` — the WAITING FOR GO line names PR number, title, base branch, method and the version in `.release-please-manifest.json`. The run stops here until the human types GO. (Where the go-gate hook runs — Claude Code, OpenCode, agy — it covers `gh pr merge`; otherwise this GO is the only guard.) Never `npm version` or `npm publish` by hand.
6. github — `<sha>` = the merge commit (`gh pr view <n> -R <owner/repo> --json mergeCommit -q .mergeCommit.oid`); `gh run list -R <owner/repo> --workflow release-please.yml --commit <sha> --limit 1 --json databaseId` (wait until a run exists), then `gh run watch <id> -R <owner/repo> --exit-status` → conclusion in the run log — exit 0
7. npm check and drift — `npm view @hybridlabor-api/aos version` → run log — always run; equals the version in `.release-please-manifest.json` on main. bdb-ecosystem-health drift report only if step 1 found the skill
8. quick-recap — run log → final line `🟢|🟡|🔴` with the released version — line written

Run log: `production_artifacts/pb-release-aos-<date>.md` in the start directory, never committed

Rules
- Anything other than the literal GO (case-insensitive) is not a GO; a GO covers only that one step, one time.
- A failed check stops the run: write the failure into the run log and report. No silent retries.
- Write one run-log line per step as it completes (`N. done|skipped|failed — artifact — check result`) and `WAITING FOR GO: <step>` at each gate.
- GO is by contract in every harness. The go-gate hook is only a backstop on Claude Code, OpenCode and agy (Codex: unverified; Cursor, Kimi: none). A missing hook is never permission to proceed.
